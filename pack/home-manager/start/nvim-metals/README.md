# nvim-metals

`nvim-metals` is a Lua plugin built to provide a better experience while using
Metals, the Scala Language Server, with Neovim's built-in [LSP
support](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html).[^no-lspconfig] You can see all
the available features
[here](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/discussions/279).

## Prerequisites

- Before you get started you need to ensure that you are using nvim v.0.7.0 or
    newer.
- Ensure [Coursier](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation) is
    installed locally.[^coursier]
- Remove `F` from `shortmess`[^shortmess]
- Ensure that you have all the LSP mappings for the core functionality you want
    setup.[^mappings]
- Ensure [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim) is
    installed.[^plenary]
- Subscribe to [this
    discussion](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/discussions/253) which
    will notify you of any breaking changes.
- Unfamiliar with Lua and Neovim? Check out the great
    [`nanotee/nvim-lua-guide`](https://github.com/nanotee/nvim-lua-guide).

## Installation

_NOTE_: This plugin works without needing to install
[neovim/nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig). If you have
it installed for other languages, that's not a problem, but make sure you do not
have Metals configured through `nvim-lspconfig` while using this plugin.[^no-lspconfig]

Example if using [`packer`](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

```lua
use({'scalameta/nvim-metals', requires = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" }})
```

## Getting started

- You can find a full [minimal example configuration
    here](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/discussions/39).
- You can find the full documentation with [`:help
    vim-metals`](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/blob/main/doc/metals.txt).
- You can find a full [list of features here](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/discussions/279).

### Settings and Commands

To view all of the available commands, check out `:help metals-commands` in the
help docs. Similarly, to see the available configuration settings check out
`:help metals-settings`.

## Integrations

To see the full details on the available configurations, checkout out `:help
metals-integrations`. The currently available integrations are:
- [nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap)
- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)


[^no-lspconfig]: If you're familiar with nvim and LSP you'll probably know of
  [`nvim-lspconfig`](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig) which also has a
  Metals configuration. Note that this is a very minimal version with no
  specific Metals commands and no Metals extensions. You can see more info on
  this [here](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/discussions/93). **DO
  NOT** try to use Metals both with `nvim-lspconfig` and with `nvim-metals` as
  stuff *will* not work right.
[^coursier]: `nvim-metals` uses Coursier to download and update Metals. _NOTE_:
  On Windows, you should run `coursier` or `cs.exe` once from the command line
  as this is how it will install itself. Once this is done you should add
  `C:\Users\YOURNAME\AppData\Coursier\data\bin` to your path. To verify that it
  is properly installed you can run `cs --help` from a new shell.
[^shortmess]: `vim.opt_global.shortmess:remove("F")` will do what you need. If
  you don't know what shortmess is, check out `:h shortmess`. Without doing
  this, autocommands that deal with filetypes prohibit messages from being
  shown, so some of the messages we show to help users get started may not be
  shown. _If_ you're confident you don't need help setting up, then just remove
  this, and `nvim-metals` will work fine, but any log messages won't actually be
  shown to you if something goes wrong with `nvim-metals`.
[^mappings]: By default methods for things like goto definition, find
  references, etc are there, but not automatically mapped. You can find a
  minimal example configuration
  [here](https://github.com/scalameta/nvim-metals/discussions/39).
[^plenary]: You're more than likely already relying on for other plugins.
  However, make sure to also have this installed as Metals uses it for things
  like Jobs, popups, and paths.
